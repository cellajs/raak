# Config
In this folder you find the config files to set up all kinds of app-specific configurations that can be made public. Each mode (`development`, `production` etc) gets a different config file.

### TODO
* Make `tunnel` mode operational
* A workflow to automate building cellajs.com with the main branch, while having the template code ready for a clean installation.
* A CLI interface that serves a migration guide when there are (breaking) changes in the cella config.
